A simple weather app using the unsplash api, openmaps, and openweather api to show you both the weather in, and around your area. I didn't code a server, since I mainly build this is a proof of concept on how to use react to make these types of websites

## Running it

```
cd reactweatherapp
npm i
npm start
```

# Todo

Everything has been done
